- Package upgrade hook handling needs love (Works, but ugly implementation)
- Implement KCM to manage hidden notification types (i.e. unset hide state from config)
- Distro upgrade stuff?
Things that could be done by other apps, but which we probably should do for now:
- Codec installation
- Checking for new Kubuntu versions
