General:
- Package upgrade hook handling needs loving. (Handling works, but the code is ugly)

0.5 goals:
* Make sure current implementation of apport/hook/reboot notifications are solid.
* Implement codec notification/installation, based on the current DBus interface.

Once 0.5.0 is released, Kubuntu Notification Helper will go into bugfix mode until
Kubuntu 10.04 is released.

1.0 goals:
* Implement KCM to manage hidden notification types (i.e. unset hide state from config)
* Possibly use an external lower-level parser for upgrade hooks rather than rolling
  our own.
* Depreciate Kubuntu-specific codec implementation, assuming apachelogger's plans for.
  the new holy system have gone upstream by that time

Once 1.0.0 is released, Kubuntu Notification Helper will ideally be feature-complete.
The project will go into semi-permanent bugfixing/maintenance mode, breaking this to
add new features if the need arises. This will provide a super-stable base for
localization work. A 2.0 release will probably mean a KDE5 port, which is still many 
years away.
