General:
- Package upgrade hook handling needs loving. (Handling works, but the code is ugly)

0.5 goals:
* Make sure current apport/hook/reboot notifications are solid for LTS. (IP)
* Implement codec notification/installation, based on the current DBus interface. (DONE)
* Implement KCM to manage hidden notification types (i.e. unset hide state) (DONE)

Once 0.5.0 is released, Kubuntu Notification Helper will go into bugfix mode until
Kubuntu 10.04 is released.

1.0 goals:
* Possibly use an external lower-level parser for upgrade hooks rather than rolling
  our own.
* Depreciate Kubuntu-specific codec implementation, assuming apachelogger's plans for
  the new holy system have gone upstream by that time

Once 1.0.0 is released, Kubuntu Notification Helper will ideally be feature-complete.
The project will go into semi-permanent bugfixing/maintenance mode, breaking this to
add new features if the need arises. This will provide a super-stable base for
localization work. A 2.0 release will probably mean a KDE5 port, which is still many 
years away.
