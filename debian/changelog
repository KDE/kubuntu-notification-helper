kubuntu-notification-helper (15.04ubuntu4) vivid; urgency=medium

  * Fix infinite recursion and language lookup in hooks LP: #1434226
    + New class Locale to rip apart an input locale and build possible
      language value combinations from it. This is needed as some hooks use
      the encoding as part of the language identifier, which the previous code
      entirely disregarded.
    + Fix inifinte recursion when reading hook fields that broke in the qt5
      port as two functions differing by argument were folded into one causing
      infinite recursion when trying to read the actual values out of the map.
    + Defer the actual reading from the map to QMap#value which is really what
      should have been used all along (use case: read value, but fall back to
      default if key is not present).
    + Introduce a simple test case for hook reading checking invalidity and
      validity and actually reading fields along with 2 localized versions in
      the formats I have seen in use.
    + Introduce a test case for the new locale class ensuring that locale
      parsing is working as well as combination construction is correct and
      returns a list with correct order.
  * Import translations from launchpad.
  * Fix kcmshell4 -> kcmshell5 call.

kubuntu-notification-helper (14.04ubuntu10) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Work around a bug in ubuntu-drivers-common not reporting the vbox
    dkms driver as recommended. Previously recommended && !installed were the
    primary requirements for a driver notification. Now we will also consider
    the possible-driver-list-length. If the list only has one entry we will
    show a notification even if that one entry is not recommended.
  * Add a kDebug to the module's ::init to see when the lazy init timer 
    actually runs out.

  * Port driverevent to new dbus API, needs some code copy for marshalling
    as doing an automarshall to variant types somehow does not work
    as expected.
    + This repairs driver availability notification
  * Instead of harcoding the init delay, allow definition through cmake,
    debian/rules now defines the standard 3 minute delay while manual builds
    will default to 1second. This removes the need to manually twiddle the
    value when one wants to test changes.

  * Catch another source of PermissionError in whoopsie-upload-all,
    this should now handle all sources of permission errors LP: #1281884
  * Implement simple unique application tracking by registering on dbus,
    this prevents multiple invocation triggers. Also, the long
    upload timeout is less concerning with a unique application.
    + Depends on python3-dbus
  * Upload timeout reduced from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. This is just as
    arbitrary a value, but really 15 minutes should be more than enough time
    for most systems. With a 30 minute timeout and a bad connection one
    can easily get into a situation where upload-all is running 24/7, reducing
    the timeout improves this at least slightly.
  * Try apport report add_*() and except (OSError, SystemError, ValueError) to
    prevent unhandled exceptions when the system runs out of disk space for

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Prevent events from spwaning more than one notifier item at a time.
    Notifications are still issued whenever show() is called as they serve
    a reminding purpose. LP: #1275427
  * Drop ubuntu-release-upgrader-qt depends (upgrade handling moved to muon)
  * Implement L10nEvent notifying the user once (after login) if the language
    support is incomplete and uses qapt-batch to complete it.
    + Add new build dep on libkubuntu to do completeness checks.
  * Event::show now only manually dispatches a KNotification iff tray icons
    are deactivated. KSNI has a dedicated showMessage function that handles
    issuing a notification for a present KSNI, this also avoids pixmap passing
    in default installation giving an overall better quality.
  * Bump KNotification pixmap size to 32x32 (from 22x22) to reduce amount of
    ugly scaling artifacts (going up or down from 32 is more reasonable than
    for example 22 to 64 - as would be the case with a plasma notification).
  * Drop unused kcm_notificationhelper-es.po (supposedly the export from
    launchpad went wrong in 13.10)
  * Change module.cpp init list to c++11 'nullptr' and fix indention level

  * Only display apport events for *.crash files.
  * Change the apportEvent slot to accept a file argument for atomic file name
    checks.
  * Introduce apport crash file validity check (must end in .crash & must
    be readable by the user & must not have .upload file & must not have
    .uploaded file).
    This greatly reduces pointless notification triggers.
  * Set VERSION_STRING via debian/rules, passed as define through cmake.
  * Use VERSION_STRING define instead of hardcoding versions.
  * Rename CMake project from notificationhelper to kubuntu-notification-helper
  * whoopsie-integration-set:
    + Add new class CrashFile to apportevent.h
      This class has the properties validity and autouploadallowed. Former
      is representing regular validity as mentioned above and latter checks
      for the presence of a .drkonq-accept file allowing upload via whoopsie
      without going through apport-kde.
    + Add new function to the module ::apportDirEvent() isolating directory
      batch checking when param path isEmpty.
    + Add new function to ApportEvent ::batchUploadAllowed() uploading
      all crashes that have been cleared by drkonqi without going through
      apport-kde.
    + For each file, regardless of processed in ::apportDirEvent (dir) or
      ::apportEvent (single file), a CrashFile instance is created and if
      autoUploadAllowed is true a script is invoked to batch upload all
      reports without GUI confirmation through whoopsie.
    + Add script whoopsie-upload-all (derived from apport's version) which
      will auto-upload all crashes with a .drkonqi-accept file.

  * Make sure to initialize the KStatusNotifierItem object's pointer with 0,

    behavior of accessing an un-initialized pointer. Fixes a crash that occurs

  * Add optional system tray notification option, as well as a tray icon/
    KDE popup notification combo option. With this option, the popup does not
    stay around forever, and does not have actions embedded in the popup.
    The popup retains persistency and embedded action buttons in popup-only

  * Fix a small memory leak where the install dialog was not deleted when

  * Several small optimizations by passing QStrings by reference, as well as
    improved use of initializer lists.
  * Clarify that packages suggested for installation by InstallEvent may not
    always be suggested due to non-free-ness, but also due to Live CD size
    constraints, as in the case of KScreensaver. Also remove the bit saying
    that all packages suggested for installation are multimedia-related,
