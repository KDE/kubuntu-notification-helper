kubuntu-notification-helper (14.04ubuntu6) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Prevent events from spwaning more than one notifier item at a time.
    Notifications are still issued whenever show() is called as they serve
    a reminding purpose. LP: #1275427
  * Drop ubuntu-release-upgrader-qt depends (upgrade handling moved to muon)
  * Implement L10nEvent notifying the user once (after login) if the language
    support is incomplete and uses qapt-batch to complete it.
    + Add new build dep on libkubuntu to do completeness checks.
  * Event::show now only manually dispatches a KNotification iff tray icons
    are deactivated. KSNI has a dedicated showMessage function that handles
    issuing a notification for a present KSNI, this also avoids pixmap passing
    in default installation giving an overall better quality.
  * Bump KNotification pixmap size to 32x32 (from 22x22) to reduce amount of
    ugly scaling artifacts (going up or down from 32 is more reasonable than
    for example 22 to 64 - as would be the case with a plasma notification).
  * Drop unused kcm_notificationhelper-es.po (supposedly the export from
    launchpad went wrong in 13.10)
  * Change module.cpp init list to c++11 'nullptr' and fix indention level

  [ Rohan Garg ]
  * Add a DriverEvent class to show notifications when the system has extra
    drivers that can be installed.
    + Misc. bug fixes

  * Add more useful debug output regarding the apport event.
  * Install whoopsie-upload-all as PROGRAMS, otherwise cmake won't set
    the executable flags and execution won't work.

  * Only display apport events for *.crash files.
  * Change the apportEvent slot to accept a file argument for atomic file name
    checks.
  * Introduce apport crash file validity check (must end in .crash & must
    be readable by the user & must not have .upload file & must not have
    .uploaded file).
    This greatly reduces pointless notification triggers.
  * Set VERSION_STRING via debian/rules, passed as define through cmake.
  * Use VERSION_STRING define instead of hardcoding versions.
  * Rename CMake project from notificationhelper to kubuntu-notification-helper
  * whoopsie-integration-set:
    + Add new class CrashFile to apportevent.h
      This class has the properties validity and autouploadallowed. Former
      is representing regular validity as mentioned above and latter checks
      for the presence of a .drkonq-accept file allowing upload via whoopsie
      without going through apport-kde.
    + Add new function to the module ::apportDirEvent() isolating directory
      batch checking when param path isEmpty.
    + Add new function to ApportEvent ::batchUploadAllowed() uploading
      all crashes that have been cleared by drkonqi without going through
      apport-kde.
    + For each file, regardless of processed in ::apportDirEvent (dir) or
      ::apportEvent (single file), a CrashFile instance is created and if
      autoUploadAllowed is true a script is invoked to batch upload all
      reports without GUI confirmation through whoopsie.
    + Add script whoopsie-upload-all (derived from apport's version) which
      will auto-upload all crashes with a .drkonqi-accept file.

  * Implement reboot on kdelibs upstream version changes (LP: #553182)
    kdelibs-bin is supposed to create /var/run/reboot-required-kdelibs in
    its postinst, containing the installed upstream version. If the version
    is different from the one the module was started with a reboot event
    is shown.

  [ Jonathan Thomas ]
  * Check the result of QApt Batch in InstallEvent before we triumphantly
    declare success. (LP: #745133)
  * Make sure to initialize the KStatusNotifierItem object's pointer with 0,
    otherwise crashes will occur when trying to delete it due to the undefinied
    behavior of accessing an un-initialized pointer. Fixes a crash that occurs
    when k-n-h is configured to show only popup icons. (LP: #780718)
  * Use HIG-compliant labels for radio buttons. (No double negatives)

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Properly KProcess DisplayIf hook conditions as shell commands.
    Trying to evaluate a complex expression as program will make the process
    die and return as zombie! OMG! (LP: #515138)
  * If a hook is not valid and a notification is not required schedule the
    hook for deletion via event loop to save memory.
  * Use QLatin1String when useful in HookEvent 
  * In unused distupgradevent do not leak KProcess on availability checks.
  * Nice fact about KProcess... when starting detached you can actually
    throw away the KProcess right away (or reuse it). Consequently do not
    heap the KProcess for terminal Hook invocation, but keep it on the stack.
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.2

  [ Jonathan Thomas ]
  * Add optional system tray notification option, as well as a tray icon/
    KDE popup notification combo option. With this option, the popup does not
    stay around forever, and does not have actions embedded in the popup.
    The popup retains persistency and embedded action buttons in popup-only
    mode.
  * Fix a small memory leak where the install dialog was not deleted when
    closed via the window decoration buttons.
  * Several small optimizations by passing QStrings by reference, as well as
    improved use of initializer lists.
  * Clarify that packages suggested for installation by InstallEvent may not
    always be suggested due to non-free-ness, but also due to Live CD size
    constraints, as in the case of KScreensaver. Also remove the bit saying
    that all packages suggested for installation are multimedia-related,
    since some of them aren't.
  * Split the packages suggested for installation into more groups, so that
    web browsers don't suggest CD codecs when installing flash, and vice-versa

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * In src/daemon/installevent/installevent.cpp replace Xine plugin with
