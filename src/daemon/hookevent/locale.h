 * @brief Helper class dealing with hook locale strings
 * Hook locale strings are somewhat random nonesense (e.g. they can be
 *  language.encoding even though the string encoding always is utf-8 anyway).
 * So, this class allows building all combinations off of a locale that could
 * potentially be used for the locale identifier in a hook.
 * This list is ordered by preference.
